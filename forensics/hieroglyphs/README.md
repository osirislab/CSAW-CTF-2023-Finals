# hieroglyphs

This is a variant on your standard "geoguesser" challenge. Competitors need to figure out, via hieroglyphs, that the person being referenced is Hatshepsut. Shouldn't be too hard, I managed to translate this in freshman year

Full translation by me:

Inside the cartouche, which contains the name of the person - Re, ka

This is the throne name of Hatshepsut, an abbreviated form of Ma'atkare

Below the cartouche, line by line:

Beloved of,

Amun

Give Life

Forever
