The declarant expressed satisfaction in the allowance granted by their employer to utilize external keyboards with the company-issued laptop. 

This privilege facilitated the pursuit of stenographic practice during working hours. 

The declarant proceeded to detail the creation of a website, notable for its unique security measure. 

Instead of conventional password protection, the website's access hinged on the submission of a proof of work. 

The password consisted of a word that has a prefix of the number one thousand three hundred thirty-seven. 
The password describes a system of modified spellings used primarily on the Internet and also goes by eleet.

This proof of work entailed the requirement of a password that is concatenated with a specific numerical value to yield, when subjected to the sha256 cryptographic algorithm, a resultant hash with precisely five leading hexadecimal zeros.
