# Ancient Forensics
Find out what happened to a machine and answer the questions in the script to get the flag.

## Introduction
You are a Computer Science student who just got your degree. Knowing this, your grandmother asks you to find out what happened to her computer, whose files went missing.

You ask her if she didn't delete it by mistake, but she says she didn't. She doesnâ€™t remember exactly what happened to the computer or when it happened. She also doesn't know the computer's operating system or any other relevant information. Grandma now wants you to write a forensics report detailing what happened to her computer, promising cookies as a reward.

## Challenge
As a lazy computer scientist who does not like to write, you decide to use an automated reporting tool that only requires you to fill out a form to write a complete report.

The script `solver.py` will ask you some questions about the computer and do the rest of the job for you.

## Evidence
Grandma provided you with an E01 forensics image `image.E01`, which she generated from the computer sometime after the attack. You need to analyze this image to get all the required information asked in the questions.
