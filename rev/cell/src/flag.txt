PS3 Challenge Ideas:

For 5 seconds, do continuous polling - 

Some game, need to input an exact series of inputs and your series of inputs acts as a private key for a public key to show some string. You can make the inputs whatever, and then public key (to be decrypted to) whatever), can generate the corresponding bytes after.

- do a read from the screen, overwrite random parts of the buffer with graphics data
- read a file from the PS3 SD Card, the buffers have to be the samem
- have big memory buffer - start reading to it for some amount of time
